we experience the world on a number of different levels

## How people experience the world

People experience things at different levels; e.g., getting married
vs. eating a meal. The same person will experience moving their desk
vs. moving jobs. Likewise, different people can experience the same
event quite differently. We have borrowed this model because it is
useful. Some people think of this as going to higher levels (the
mountain); others as going deeper (the well).

## LEVELS OF EXPERIENCE

**Levels of experience** is a *model* used to sort data into that
gives a rich picture of the current and future states of an
organization. The data we have gathered fits in one of the logical
levels, and the relationships between these levels makes it clearer
what people meant. Often two or more pieces of data may seem
contradictory, but when sorted into logical levels make
sense. Likewise, one can use the sorting to gain an understanding of
the magnitude and type of change needed. In addition, threads of
change become clearer, with various pieces of data at different
logical levels supporting each other.

From bottom to top, or from the outside in, the levels are:


### Environment

What do people live in? Live with?

**Examples**
* work cubicles are 8 x 8
* organization is geographically dispersed
* more demand than time available

### Behavior

What are people doing? Seeing? Hearing?

**Examples**
* people come in on weekends
* hall discussions are animated, exciting
* people normally arrive at meetings 10 minutes late

### Skills/Capabilities

What can people do? Capabilities are learned, repeated, consistent
actions.

**Examples**
* engineers know how to code in C++
* managers can create realistic schedules
* people can form teams quickly

### Values/beliefs

What do people think is important?

**Examples**
* the work we do is important
* it is hard to change this place
* nobody beats us
- trust and respect for individuals
- achievement and contribution
- uncompromising integrity
- teamwork
- flexibility and innovation

Values and beliefs are principles that guide our actions and
determine how we view ourselves, how we react to others, and what we
make of our experience. Think about the rewards that really matter to
people. Is it money? Doing something interesting? Learning? Being part
of something important? A particular label, such as a title?
Contributing to a particular mission? What is the organization
rewarding?

What is often interesting is determine the difference between expressed
values and practiced values.

### Identity

Who are they as a group?

**Examples**
* we are the fastest ship in the fleet
* we are firefighters
* we are the Redwoods in this forest

Identity is frequently expressed as a metaphor, e.g., a real
estate company that called themselves the IBM of real estate.

### Purpose/mission

Why does the organization exist?

**Examples**
* we make systems work
* we keep the automotive customers with HP
* we give our customers solutions to their printing needs

## An Example: The European Community

The European Community is trying to align different European countries
by working at the environment and behavior levels (defining size of
bananas, meat content of sausage, or setting tax levels or standard
working hours). What would it be like if EC focused on establishing a
mission for Europe as a trading block or defined values such as
protecting the oil industry or investing in new high technology?

## Benefits of sorting using the levels of experience

Is there alignment within the organization for the desired state? If
not, need to start there. Designing: if it's greenfield you can start
with mission and who do you need to be, etc. The question "What does
that get you?" generally raises the answer one level. The cost of
change, how big the change is, how hard it is, how long it might take,
the risk involved. For example, just a capability change vs. values
and beliefs vs. identity
