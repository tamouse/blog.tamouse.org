<p>Interstate highways that run through major urban centers eventually

  <h1 id="where-will-all-the-traffic-go">Where will all the traffic go?</h1>

  <p><strong>Interstate highways running through dense city centers strangle the
potential for those cities to flourish. The highways are falling apart
anyway; let’s tear them down. The timing is perfect.</strong></p>

  <p>The most loved cities in the world — like Paris, London, New York, San
Francisco — are walkable, safe, and have wide range of services, parks
and other amenities in close range to each other. They are “congested”
in a good way. Younger americans (millennials), young professionals, and
even affluent retirees are increasingly moving to more vibrant downtown
areas to attain a more walkable life.</p>

  <p>At the same time, America’s postwar highway infrastructure is crumbling
and cities are faced with a hefty repair bill they can’t afford. This is
a huge opportunity for many cities — like Buffalo, Cleveland, Dallas,
Detroit, New Orleans, Louisville, and Seattle — to do something great.
They all have deteriorating highways which are destroying their
potentially most desirable properties. These highways concentrate
traffic in a way that creates pedestrian barriers and discourages the
building of rich communities.</p>

  <p>Whenever the general public hears about a proposal to remove <em>part</em>of a
inner-city highway, they part into two initial camps. A minority
immediately understand the benefit and historical precedents for
removing portions of these highways. However, the majority of people
initially support the status quo and cry out, “OH GOD, WHERE WILL ALL
THAT TRAFFIC GO!” Because of this fear, many cities end up reinforcing
and expanding highways, which makes the traffic worse. This is called
“induced demand.” When a highway becomes bigger, it draws in more
traffic.</p>

  <p><img src="https://d233eq3e3p3cv0.cloudfront.net/max/350/0*t52WanexNtIocUd4.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

  <p>To the left is a picture of from the San Francisco Chronicle in 1996
after the Central Highway was removed and replaced with a boulevard
helping to create one of the most fashionable quarters of the city. The
traffic dissappeared and “they have no idea how they did it.”</p>

  <p>The frustrating part is that we know what happens to the traffic. We
have tons of historical examples for this kind of transformation
including San Francisco, New York, Portland, Milwaukee and even cities
abroad like
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/arts/design/in-madrid-even-maybe-the-bronx-parks-replace-freeways.html?pagewanted=all">Madrid</a>
and
<a href="http://grist.org/infrastructure/2011-04-04-seoul-korea-tears-down-an-urban-highway-life-goes-on/?ref=se">Seoul</a>.
In all cases, the traffic gets defused in three primary ways:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Regional Dispersion</strong>. Much of the traffic disappears immediately
because it’s just passing through to a farther destination. When the
West Side Highway in NYC came down, 53 percent of traffic just
disappeared because it was cars in New Jersey enjoying a short-cut,
but destroying NYC in the meantime. A variety of highways around the
city can take on this traffic. This is why they exist. Intra-city
highways (which Eisenhower opposed) pull traffic away from the grid
and concentrate it in a way that makes it impossible for people to
develop residencies and/or businesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Dispersion.</strong> Density of intersections open up possibilities
for other modes of transportation like walking, biking, or public
transit. Interestingly, when a smaller grid of boulevards are intact
and fully utilized, they can carry much more capacity than a
highway. This is why Montreal prohibited them in the first place,
they found the grid can handle twice the capacity of any highway.
And now it’s considered one of the most livable cities in the world.</li>
    <li><strong>New Proximities:</strong> When a city successfully builds a rich network
for social and economic exchange, the need to travel such long
distances for daily tasks falls sharply. Do you want to eat, do
dry-cleaning, or see a movie? Just walk down the street. A developed
street &amp; block structure can meet most needs and results in a
variety of other benefits like saved car expenses, increased safety,
better tax-base, and more jobs.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>My own city of Dallas, TX is facing this challenge currently. The
crumbling stretch of highway dividing Downtown from East Dallas —the
largest contiguous area of walkable grid — forms a noose around Downtown
Dallas. It’s dead right now. The city is taking proposals from TxDOT who
has offered 9 proposals for repairing the highway and none for removing
it. Luckily we have <a href="http://www.carfreeinbigd.com/">Patrick Kennedy</a>, an
urban planner that has compiled copious research on this area and is
beginning an uphill campaign to have a 10th option “considered,” which
involves removing that portion of the highway. The campaign is called
“<a href="http://anewdallas.com/">A New Dallas.</a>”</p>

  <p>While the local data seems like a slam dunk (to me), I find the
historical examples most powerful because they get around needing to
answer every little local concern that someone might raise. The examples
below are well known, but Patrick has culled together quantified data on
each city in a way that rises above argumentation. His numerous sources
are listed at the <a href="http://anewdallas.com/research.html">bottom of this
page</a>.</p>

  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p>If your city faces this debate, start fighting and help to educate your
peers, particularly around the affected areas. There are many resources
for more information online like the <a href="http://www.cnu.org/highways">Congress of New
Urbanism</a>, which keeps track of what’s
happening around the country.</p>

  <p>Ultimately this kind of initiative requires a political champion, so
research your local representatives and vote. We have the power to make
our cities great, but the status quo will always be the greatest enemy
of progress.</p>
