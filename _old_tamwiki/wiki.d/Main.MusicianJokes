Auditioning%0aWhen the drummer sits down at the kit for his audition, the band leader says, "Can you start with a samba pattern on your bass drum?"%0a%0aThe drummer obliges with a boob b-boom samba pattern.%0a%0aThe leader then asks, "Can you add a Mozambique cowbell pattern along with that, with your right hand?"%0a%0aThe drummer thinks, "I can do that, no problem" and obliges, giving it his best Steve Gadd possible.%0a%0aHe is then told, "Now add a 2-3 clave with your left foot on the hi-hat."%0a%0aThe drummer struggles a little, but gets it happening.%0a%0aNext he hears, "Now add a cascara pattern on the snare with your left hand."%0a%0aYears of studying Gary Chester and listening to world music finally come to fruition and the relieved drummer finds he can play the whole pattern. Pleased with himself, while he's still playing, he turns to the band leader "So! do I get the job?"%0a%0a"Hell, no!", snarls the bandleader. "That kind of crap is why we fired the last guy."%0a%0a!!!Drummers in Iraq%0aIn New York City, an out of work jazz drummer named Ed was thinking of throwing himself off a bridge. But then he ran into a former booking agent who told him about the fantastic opportunities for drummers in Iraq. The agent said "If you can find your way over there, just take my card and look up the bandleader named Faisal--he's the large guy with the beard wearing gold pajamas and shoes that curl up at the toes." Ed hit up everyone he knew and borrowed enough to buy transport to Iraq. It took several days to arrange for passport, visas, transportation into Iraq and the shipping of his equipment, but he was finally on his way.%0a%0aEd arrived in Baghdad and immediately started searching for Faisal. He found guys in pajamas of every color but gold. Finally, in a small coffeehouse, he saw a huge man with a beard--wearing gold pajamas and shoes that curled up at the toes! Ed approached him and asked if he was Faisal. He was. Ed gave him the agent's card and Faisal's face brightened into a huge smile.%0a%0a"You're just in time--I need you for a gig tonight. Meet me at the market near the mosque at 7:30 with your equipment."%0a%0a"But," gasped Ed, "what about a rehearsal?"%0a%0a"No time--don't worry." And with that, Faisal disappeared.%0a%0aEd arrived in the market at 7:00 to set up his gear. He introduced himself to the other musicians, who were all playing instruments he had never seen in his life. At 7:30 sharp, Faisal appeared and hopped on the bandstand, his gold pajamas glittering in the twilight. Without a word to the musicians, he lifted his arm for the downbeat.%0a%0a"Wait." shouted Ed. "What are we playing?"%0a%0aFaisal shot him a look of frustration and shouted back, "Fake it! Just give me heavy afterbeats on 7 and 13."%0a----%0a!!!That's no accordian...%0aA drummer, sick of all the drummer jokes, decides to change his instrument.

We have a vacancy in our celestial symphony orchestra for a trombonist. Why don't you turn up at the next rehearsal."%0a%0aSo, when the time for the next rehearsal arrived our friend turned up with his heavenly trombone [sic]. As he took his seat God moved, in a mysterious way, to the podium and tapped his batton to bring the players to attention. Our friend turned to the angelic second trombonist (!) and whispered, "So, what's God like as a conductor?"%0a%0a"Oh, he's O.K. most of the time, but occasionally he thinks he's von Karajan."%0a%0aIt was the night of the big symphony concert, and all the town notables showed up to hear it. However, it was getting close to 8 o'clock and the conductor hadn't yet shown up. The theater's manager was getting desperate, knowing that he'd have to refund everyone's money if he cancelled the concert, so he went backstage and asked all the musicians if any could conduct.%0a%0aNone of them could, so he went around and asked the staff if any of them could conduct. He had no luck there either, so he started asking people in the lobby, in the hope that maybe one of them could conduct the night's concert.%0a%0aHe still hadn't found anyone, so he went outside and started asking everybody passing by if they could conduct. He had no luck whatsoever and by this time the concert was 15 minutes late in starting. The assistant manager came out to say that the crowd was getting restless and about ready to demand their money back.%0a%0aThe desperate manager looked around and spied a cat, a dog, and a horse standing in the street. "Oh, what the heck," he exclaimed, "let's ask them--what do we have to lose?"%0a%0aSo the manager and assistant manager went up to the cat, and the manager asked "Mr. cat, do you know how to conduct?" The cat meowed "I don't know, I'll try," but though it tried really hard, it just couldn't stand upright on its hind legs. The manager sighed and thanked the cat, and then moved on to the dog.%0a%0a"Mr. dog," he asked, "do you think you can conduct?" The dog woofed "Let me see," but although it was able to stand up on its hind legs and wave its front paws around, it just couldn't keep upright long enough to last through an entire movement.%0a%0a"Well, nice try," the manager told the dog, and with a sigh of resignation turned to the horse. "Mr. horse," he asked, "how about you--can you conduct?" The horse looked at him for a second and then without a word turned around, presented its hind end, and started swishing its tail in perfect four-four time.%0a%0a"That's it!" the manager exclaimed, "the concert can go on!" However, right then the horse dropped a load of plop onto the street. The assistant manager was horrified, and he told the manager "We can't have this horse conduct! What would the orchestra think?"%0a%0aThe manager looked first at the horse's rear end and then at the plop lying in the street and replied "trust me--from this angle, the orchestra won't even know they have a new conductor!"%0a%0a----%0a%0aOnce upon a time, there was a blind rabbit and blind snake, both living in the same neighborhood. One beautiful day, the blind rabbit was hopping happily down the path toward his home, when he bumped into someone. Apologizing profusely he explained, "I am blind, and didn't see you there."%0a%0a"Perfectly all right," said the snake, "because I am blind, too, and did not see to step out of your way."%0a%0aA conversation followed, gradually becoming more intimate, and finally the snake said, "This is the best conversation I have had with anyone for a long time. Would you mind if I felt you to see what you are like?"%0a%0a"Why, no," said the rabbit. "Go right ahead."%0a%0aSo the snake wrapped himself around the rabbit and shuffled and snuggled his coils, and said, "MMMM! You're soft and warm and fuzzy and cuddly...and those ears! You must be a rabbit."%0a%0a"Why, that's right!" said the rabbit. "May I feel you?"%0a%0a"Go right ahead." said the snake, stretching himself out full length on the path.%0a%0aThe rabbit began to stroke the snake's body with his paws, then drew back in disgust. "Yuck!" he said. "You're cold...and slimy... you must be a conductor!"%0a%0a----%0a%0aA guy walks into a pet store wanting a parrot. The store clerk shows him two beautiful ones out on the floor. "This one's $5,000 and the other is $10,000." the clerk said.%0a%0a"Wow! What does the $5,000 one do?"%0a%0a"This parrot can sing every aria Mozart ever wrote."%0a%0a"And the other?" said the customer.%0a%0a"This one can sing Wagner's entire Ring cycle. There's another one in the back room for $30,000."%0a%0a"Holy moly! What does that one do?"%0a%0a"Nothing that I can tell, but the other two parrots call him 'Maestro'."%0a%0a----%0a%0a"Mommy," said the little girl, "can I get pregnant by anal intercourse?"%0a%0a"Of course you can." her mother replied. "How do you think conductors are made?"%0a%0a----%0a%0aA new conductor was at his first rehearsal. It was not going well. He was wary of the musicians as they were of him. As he left the rehearsal room, the timpanist sounded a rude little "bong." The angry conductor turned and said, "All right! Who did that?"%0a%0a----%0a%0aA violinist was auditioning for the Halle orchestra in England. After his audition he was talking with the conductor. "What do you think about Brahms?" asked the conductor.%0a%0a"Ah..." the violinist replied, "Brahms is a great guy! Real talented musician. In fact, he and I were just playing some duets together last week!"%0a%0aThe conductor was impressed. "And what do you think of Mozart?" he asked him.%0a%0a"Oh, he's just swell! I just had dinner with him last week!" replied the violinist. Then the violinist looked at his watch and said he had to leave to catch the 1:30 train to London.%0a%0aAfterwards, the conductor was discussing him with the board members. He said he felt very uneasy about hiring this violinist, because there seemed to be a serious credibility gap. The conductor knew for certain that there was no 1:30 train to London.%0a%0a----%0a%0aA Player's Guide for Keeping Conductors in Line%0a%0aby Donn Laurence Mills%0a%0aIf there were a basic training manual for orchestra players, it might include ways to practice not only music, but one-upmanship. It seems as if many young players take pride in getting the conductor's goat. The following rules are intended as a guide to the development of habits that will irritate the conductor. (Variations and additional methods depend upon the imagination and skill of the player.)%0a%0a# Never be satisfied with the tuning note. Fussing about the pitch takes attention away from the podium and puts it on you, where it belongs.%0a# When raising the music stand, be sure the top comes off and spills the music on the floor.%0a# Complain about the temperature of the rehearsal room, the lighting, crowded space, or a draft. It's best to do this when the conductor is under pressure.%0a# Look the other way just before cues.%0a# Never have the proper mute, a spare set of strings, or extra reeds. Percussion players must never have all their equipment.%0a# Ask for a re-audition or seating change. Ask often. Give the impression you're about to quit. Let the conductor know you're there as a personal favor.%0a# Pluck the strings as if you are checking tuning at every opportunity, especially when the conductor is giving instructions. Brass players: drop mutes. Percussionists have a wide variety of dropable items, but cymbals are unquestionably the best because they roll around for several seconds.%0a# Loudly blow water from the keys during pauses (Horn, oboe and clarinet players are trained to do this from birth).%0a# Long after a passage has gone by, ask the conductor if your C# was in tune. This is especially effective if you had no C# or were not playing at the time. (If he catches you, pretend to be correcting a note in your part.)%0a# At dramatic moments in the music (while the conductor is emoting) be busy marking your music so that the climaxes will sound empty and disappointing.%0a# Wait until well into a rehearsal before letting the conductor know you don't have the music.%0a# Look at your watch frequently. Shake it in disbelief occasionally.%0a# Tell the conductor, "I can't find the beat." Conductors are always sensitive about their "stick technique", so challenge it frequently.%0a# As the conductor if he has listened to the Bernstein recording of the piece. Imply that he could learn a thing or two from it. Also good: ask "Is this the first time you've conducted this piece?"%0a# When rehearsing a difficult passage, screw up your face and shake your head indicating that you'll never be able to play it. Don't say anything: make him wonder.%0a# If your articulation differs from that of others playing the same phrase, stick to your guns. Do not ask the conductor which is correct until backstage just before the concert.%0a# Find an excuse to leave rehearsal about 15 minutes early so that others will become restless and start to pack up and fidget.%0a# During applause, smile weakly or show no expression at all. Better yet, nonchalantly put away your instrument. Make the conductor feel he is keeping you from doing something really important.%0a%0aIt is time that players reminded their conductors of the facts of life: just who do conductors think they are, anyway?%0a%0aDonn Laurence Mills is the NSOA contributing editor.

As a matter of fact, every player in the orchestra had missed several rehearsals, except for one very faithful oboe player.

After years of a peaceful co-existence, the Amati shop decided to put a sign in the window saying: "We make the best violins in Italy." The Guarneri shop soon followed suit, and put a sign in their window proclaiming: "We make the best violins in the world." Finally, the Stradivarius family put a sign out at their shop saying: "We make the best violins on the block."%0a----%0aOnce there was a violinist who got a gig to play a recital at a mental institution. He played the recital brilliantly, and backstage after the concert, he got a visit from one of the institutionalized patients.%0a%0a"Oh, the concert you played was just lovely. The Paganini caprice was stunning, the counterpoint in the Bach came out so clearly, and the phrasing in your Debussy was just exquisite!", said the patient.%0a%0a"Why, thank you," said the musician (thinking this person seemed pretty normal for a institutionalized person). "Are you by chance a musician?"%0a%0a"Oh yes, I was concertmaster of an orchestra for many years, I've played all of the major concertos: Tchaikowsky, Brahms, Mozart, all the major ones." said the patient.%0a%0a"Wow, that's impressive," said the violinist. "Did you do recitals as well?"%0a%0a"Oh yes, I've done all the major sonatas, Bach, Kreisler, Vieuxtemps, all of the major ones," said the patient.%0a%0a"Wow! Did you ever do chamber music?" asked the violinist.%0a%0a"Oh yes. Duets, trios, quintets, sextets, all the major repertoire," said the patient.%0a%0aPuzzled, the violinist asked "Did you ever play string quartets?"%0a%0aAll of the suddenly the patient went berserk and shouted "String quartets!... String quartets!... String quartets!... "%0a----%0aQuite a number of years ago, the Seattle Symphony was doing Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 under the baton of Milton Katims.%0a%0aNow at this point, you must understand two things:%0a*    There's a quite long segment in this symphony where the basses don't have a thing to do. Not a single note for page after page.%0a*    There used to be a tavern called Dez's 400, right across the street from the Seattle Opera House, rather favored by local musicians.%0a%0aIt had been decided that during this performance, once the bass players had played their parts in the opening of the symphony, they were to quietly lay down their instruments and leave the stage, rather than sit on thier stools looking and feeling dumb for twenty minutes. Once they got backstage, someone suggested that they trot across the street and quaff a few brews.%0a%0aWhen they got there, a European nobleman recognized that they were musicians, and bought them several rounds of drinks. Two of the bassists passed out, and the rest of the section, not to mention the nobleman, were rather drunk. Finally, one of them looked at his watch and exclaimed, "Look at the time! We'll be late!"%0a%0aThe remaining bassists tried in vain to wake up their section mates, but finally those who were still conscious had to give up and run across the street to the Opera House.%0a%0aWhile they were on their way in, the bassist who suggested this excursion in the first place said, "I think we'll still have enough time--I anticipated that something like this could happen, so I tied a string around the last pages of the score. When he gets down to there, Milton's going to have to slow the tempo way down while he waves the baton with one hand and fumbles with the string with the other."%0a%0aSure enough, when they got back to the stage they hadn't missed their entrance, but one look at their conductor's face told them they were still in serious trouble. Katims was furious! After all...%0a%0a->It was the bottom of the Ninth,\\%0athe basses were loaded,\\%0athe score was tied,\\%0athere were two men out,\\%0aand the Count was full.%0a%0a----%0aThe following program notes are from an unidentified piano recital.%0a%0aTonight's page turner, Ruth Spelke, studied under Ivan Schmertnick at the Boris Nitsky School of Page Turning in Philadelphia. She has been turning pages here and abroad for many years for some of the world's leading pianists.%0a%0aIn 1988, Ms. Spelke won the Wilson Page Turning Scholarship, which sent her to Israel to study page turning from left to right. She is winner of the 1984 Rimsky Korsakov Flight of the Bumblebee Prestissimo Medal, having turned 47 pages in an unprecedented 32 seconds. She was also a 1983 silver medalist at the Klutz Musical Page Pickup Competition: contestants retrieve and rearrange a musical score dropped from a Yamaha. Ms. Spelke excelled in "grace, swiftness, and especially poise."%0a%0aFor techniques, Ms. Spelke performs both the finger-licking and the bent-page corner methods. She works from a standard left bench position, and is the originator of the dipped-elbow page snatch, a style used to avoid obscuring the pianist's view of the music. She is page turner in residence in Fairfield Iowa, where she occupies the coveted Alfred Hitchcock Chair at the Fairfield Page Turning Institute.%0a%0aMs. Spelke is married, and has a nice house on a lake.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!!Orchestra Personnel Standards%0a%0a!!!!conductor%0a* Leaps tall buildings in a single bound.%0a* Is more powerful than a locomotive.%0a* Is faster than a speeding bullet.%0a* Walks on water.%0a* Gives policy to God. %0a!!!!concertmaster%0a* Leaps short buildings in a single bound.%0a* Is more powerful than a switch engine.%0a* Is just as fast as a speeding bullet.%0a* Walks on water if sea is calm.%0a* Talks with God. %0a!!!!oboist%0a* Leaps short buildings with a running start and favorable winds.%0a* Is almost as powerful as a switch engine.%0a* Is almost as fast as a speeding bullet.%0a* Walks on water in an indoor swimming pool.%0a* Talks with God if special request is approved. %0a!!!!trumpet player%0a* Barely clears a quonset hut.%0a* Loses tug-of-war with locomotive.%0a* Can fire a speeding bullet.%0a* Swims well.%0a* Is occasionally addressed by God. %0a!!!!bassoonist%0a* Makes marks high on wall when trying to clear short buildings.%0a* Is run over by locomotive.%0a* Can sometimes handle a gun without inflicting self-injury.%0a* Dog-paddles.%0a* Talks to animals. %0a!!!!second violinist%0a* Runs into buildings.%0a* Recognizes locomotives two times out of three.%0a* Is not issued any ammunition.%0a* Can stay afloat with a life jacket.%0a* Talks to walls, argues with self. %0a!!!!manager%0a* Falls over doorstep when trying to enter buildings.%0a* Says "Look at the choo-choo."%0a* Wets self with water pistol.%0a* Plays in mud puddles.%0a* Loses arguments with self. %0a!!!!horn player%0a* Lifts buildings and walks under them.%0a* Kicks locomotives off the tracks.%0a* Catches speeding bullets in teeth and eats them.%0a* Freezes water with a single glance.%0a* Is God. %0a%0a!!Math/Logic Quiz%0a%0a* Wilson is tired of paying for clarinet reeds.

But then he ran into a former booking agent who told him about the fantastic opportunities for drummers in Iraq. The agent said "If you can find your way over there, just take my card and look up the bandleader named Faisal--he's the large guy with the beard wearing gold pajamas and shoes that curl up at the toes." Ed hit up everyone he knew and borrowed enough to buy transport to Iraq. It took several days to arrange for passport, visas, transportation into Iraq and the shipping of his equipment, but he was finally on his way.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ed arrived in Baghdad and immediately started searching for Faisal. He found guys in pajamas of every color but gold. Finally, in a small coffeehouse, he saw a huge man with a beard--wearing gold pajamas and shoes that curled up at the toes! Ed approached him and asked if he was Faisal. He was. Ed gave him the agent's card and Faisal's face brightened into a huge smile.%0a%3c %0a%3c "You're just in time--I need you for a gig tonight. Meet me at the market near the mosque at 7:30 with your equipment."%0a%3c %0a%3c "But," gasped Ed, "what about a rehearsal?"%0a%3c %0a%3c "No time--don't worry." And with that, Faisal disappeared.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ed arrived in the market at 7:00 to set up his gear. He introduced himself to the other musicians, who were all playing instruments he had never seen in his life. At 7:30 sharp, Faisal appeared and hopped on the bandstand, his gold pajamas glittering in the twilight. Without a word to the musicians, he lifted his arm for the downbeat.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Wait." shouted Ed. "What are we playing?"%0a%3c %0a%3c Faisal shot him a look of frustration and shouted back, "Fake it! Just give me heavy afterbeats on 7 and 13."%0a49,87c23,25%0a%3c !!!That's no accordian...%0a%3c A drummer, sick of all the drummer jokes, decides to change his instrument.

However, it was getting close to 8 o'clock and the conductor hadn't yet shown up. The theater's manager was getting desperate, knowing that he'd have to refund everyone's money if he cancelled the concert, so he went backstage and asked all the musicians if any could conduct.%0a%3c %0a%3c None of them could, so he went around and asked the staff if any of them could conduct. He had no luck there either, so he started asking people in the lobby, in the hope that maybe one of them could conduct the night's concert.%0a%3c %0a%3c He still hadn't found anyone, so he went outside and started asking everybody passing by if they could conduct. He had no luck whatsoever and by this time the concert was 15 minutes late in starting. The assistant manager came out to say that the crowd was getting restless and about ready to demand their money back.%0a%3c %0a%3c The desperate manager looked around and spied a cat, a dog, and a horse standing in the street. "Oh, what the heck," he exclaimed, "let's ask them--what do we have to lose?"%0a%3c %0a%3c So the manager and assistant manager went up to the cat, and the manager asked "Mr. cat, do you know how to conduct?" The cat meowed "I don't know, I'll try," but though it tried really hard, it just couldn't stand upright on its hind legs. The manager sighed and thanked the cat, and then moved on to the dog.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Mr. dog," he asked, "do you think you can conduct?" The dog woofed "Let me see," but although it was able to stand up on its hind legs and wave its front paws around, it just couldn't keep upright long enough to last through an entire movement.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Well, nice try," the manager told the dog, and with a sigh of resignation turned to the horse. "Mr. horse," he asked, "how about you--can you conduct?" The horse looked at him for a second and then without a word turned around, presented its hind end, and started swishing its tail in perfect four-four time.%0a%3c %0a%3c "That's it!" the manager exclaimed, "the concert can go on!" However, right then the horse dropped a load of plop onto the street. The assistant manager was horrified, and he told the manager "We can't have this horse conduct! What would the orchestra think?"%0a%3c %0a%3c The manager looked first at the horse's rear end and then at the plop lying in the street and replied "trust me--from this angle, the orchestra won't even know they have a new conductor!"%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c Once upon a time, there was a blind rabbit and blind snake, both living in the same neighborhood.

Would you mind if I felt you to see what you are like?"%0a%3c %0a%3c "Why, no," said the rabbit. "Go right ahead."%0a%3c %0a%3c So the snake wrapped himself around the rabbit and shuffled and snuggled his coils, and said, "MMMM! You're soft and warm and fuzzy and cuddly...and those ears! You must be a rabbit."%0a%3c %0a%3c "Why, that's right!" said the rabbit. "May I feel you?"%0a%3c %0a%3c "Go right ahead." said the snake, stretching himself out full length on the path.%0a%3c %0a%3c The rabbit began to stroke the snake's body with his paws, then drew back in disgust.

It seems as if many young players take pride in getting the conductor's goat. The following rules are intended as a guide to the development of habits that will irritate the conductor. (Variations and additional methods depend upon the imagination and skill of the player.)%0a%3c %0a%3c # Never be satisfied with the tuning note. Fussing about the pitch takes attention away from the podium and puts it on you, where it belongs.%0a%3c # When raising the music stand, be sure the top comes off and spills the music on the floor.%0a%3c # Complain about the temperature of the rehearsal room, the lighting, crowded space, or a draft. It's best to do this when the conductor is under pressure.%0a%3c # Look the other way just before cues.%0a%3c # Never have the proper mute, a spare set of strings, or extra reeds. Percussion players must never have all their equipment.%0a%3c # Ask for a re-audition or seating change. Ask often. Give the impression you're about to quit. Let the conductor know you're there as a personal favor.%0a%3c # Pluck the strings as if you are checking tuning at every opportunity, especially when the conductor is giving instructions. Brass players: drop mutes. Percussionists have a wide variety of dropable items, but cymbals are unquestionably the best because they roll around for several seconds.%0a%3c # Loudly blow water from the keys during pauses (Horn, oboe and clarinet players are trained to do this from birth).%0a%3c # Long after a passage has gone by, ask the conductor if your C# was in tune. This is especially effective if you had no C# or were not playing at the time. (If he catches you, pretend to be correcting a note in your part.)%0a%3c # At dramatic moments in the music (while the conductor is emoting) be busy marking your music so that the climaxes will sound empty and disappointing.%0a%3c # Wait until well into a rehearsal before letting the conductor know you don't have the music.%0a%3c # Look at your watch frequently. Shake it in disbelief occasionally.%0a%3c # Tell the conductor, "I can't find the beat." Conductors are always sensitive about their "stick technique", so challenge it frequently.%0a%3c # As the conductor if he has listened to the Bernstein recording of the piece. Imply that he could learn a thing or two from it. Also good: ask "Is this the first time you've conducted this piece?"%0a%3c # When rehearsing a difficult passage, screw up your face and shake your head indicating that you'll never be able to play it. Don't say anything: make him wonder.%0a%3c # If your articulation differs from that of others playing the same phrase, stick to your guns. Do not ask the conductor which is correct until backstage just before the concert.%0a%3c # Find an excuse to leave rehearsal about 15 minutes early so that others will become restless and start to pack up and fidget.%0a%3c # During applause, smile weakly or show no expression at all. Better yet, nonchalantly put away your instrument. Make the conductor feel he is keeping you from doing something really important.%0a%3c %0a%3c It is time that players reminded their conductors of the facts of life: just who do conductors think they are, anyway?%0a%3c %0a%3c Donn Laurence Mills is the NSOA contributing editor.

After years of a peaceful co-existence, the Amati shop decided to put a sign in the window saying: "We make the best violins in Italy." The Guarneri shop soon followed suit, and put a sign in their window proclaiming: "We make the best violins in the world." Finally, the Stradivarius family put a sign out at their shop saying: "We make the best violins on the block."%0a%3c ----%0a%3c Once there was a violinist who got a gig to play a recital at a mental institution. He played the recital brilliantly, and backstage after the concert, he got a visit from one of the institutionalized patients.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Oh, the concert you played was just lovely. The Paganini caprice was stunning, the counterpoint in the Bach came out so clearly, and the phrasing in your Debussy was just exquisite!", said the patient.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Why, thank you," said the musician (thinking this person seemed pretty normal for a institutionalized person). "Are you by chance a musician?"%0a%3c %0a%3c "Oh yes, I was concertmaster of an orchestra for many years, I've played all of the major concertos: Tchaikowsky, Brahms, Mozart, all the major ones." said the patient.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Wow, that's impressive," said the violinist. "Did you do recitals as well?"%0a%3c %0a%3c "Oh yes, I've done all the major sonatas, Bach, Kreisler, Vieuxtemps, all of the major ones," said the patient.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Wow! Did you ever do chamber music?" asked the violinist.%0a%3c %0a%3c "Oh yes. Duets, trios, quintets, sextets, all the major repertoire," said the patient.%0a%3c %0a%3c Puzzled, the violinist asked "Did you ever play string quartets?"%0a%3c %0a%3c All of the suddenly the patient went berserk and shouted "String quartets!... String quartets!... String quartets!... "%0a%3c ----%0a%3c Quite a number of years ago, the Seattle Symphony was doing Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 under the baton of Milton Katims.%0a%3c %0a%3c Now at this point, you must understand two things:%0a%3c *    There's a quite long segment in this symphony where the basses don't have a thing to do. Not a single note for page after page.%0a%3c *    There used to be a tavern called Dez's 400, right across the street from the Seattle Opera House, rather favored by local musicians.%0a%3c %0a%3c It had been decided that during this performance, once the bass players had played their parts in the opening of the symphony, they were to quietly lay down their instruments and leave the stage, rather than sit on thier stools looking and feeling dumb for twenty minutes. Once they got backstage, someone suggested that they trot across the street and quaff a few brews.%0a%3c %0a%3c When they got there, a European nobleman recognized that they were musicians, and bought them several rounds of drinks. Two of the bassists passed out, and the rest of the section, not to mention the nobleman, were rather drunk. Finally, one of them looked at his watch and exclaimed, "Look at the time! We'll be late!"%0a%3c %0a%3c The remaining bassists tried in vain to wake up their section mates, but finally those who were still conscious had to give up and run across the street to the Opera House.%0a%3c %0a%3c While they were on their way in, the bassist who suggested this excursion in the first place said, "I think we'll still have enough time--I anticipated that something like this could happen, so I tied a string around the last pages of the score. When he gets down to there, Milton's going to have to slow the tempo way down while he waves the baton with one hand and fumbles with the string with the other."%0a%3c %0a%3c Sure enough, when they got back to the stage they hadn't missed their entrance, but one look at their conductor's face told them they were still in serious trouble. Katims was furious! After all...%0a%3c %0a%3c ->It was the bottom of the Ninth,\\%0a%3c the basses were loaded,\\%0a%3c the score was tied,\\%0a%3c there were two men out,\\%0a%3c and the Count was full.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c The following program notes are from an unidentified piano recital.%0a%3c %0a%3c Tonight's page turner, Ruth Spelke, studied under Ivan Schmertnick at the Boris Nitsky School of Page Turning in Philadelphia. She has been turning pages here and abroad for many years for some of the world's leading pianists.%0a%3c %0a%3c In 1988, Ms. Spelke won the Wilson Page Turning Scholarship, which sent her to Israel to study page turning from left to right. She is winner of the 1984 Rimsky Korsakov Flight of the Bumblebee Prestissimo Medal, having turned 47 pages in an unprecedented 32 seconds. She was also a 1983 silver medalist at the Klutz Musical Page Pickup Competition: contestants retrieve and rearrange a musical score dropped from a Yamaha. Ms. Spelke excelled in "grace, swiftness, and especially poise."%0a%3c %0a%3c For techniques, Ms. Spelke performs both the finger-licking and the bent-page corner methods. She works from a standard left bench position, and is the originator of the dipped-elbow page snatch, a style used to avoid obscuring the pianist's view of the music. She is page turner in residence in Fairfield Iowa, where she occupies the coveted Alfred Hitchcock Chair at the Fairfield Page Turning Institute.%0a%3c %0a%3c Ms. Spelke is married, and has a nice house on a lake.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a%3c !!Orchestra Personnel Standards%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!!conductor%0a%3c * Leaps tall buildings in a single bound.%0a%3c * Is more powerful than a locomotive.%0a%3c * Is faster than a speeding bullet.%0a%3c * Walks on water.%0a%3c * Gives policy to God. %0a%3c !!!!concertmaster%0a%3c * Leaps short buildings in a single bound.%0a%3c * Is more powerful than a switch engine.%0a%3c * Is just as fast as a speeding bullet.%0a%3c * Walks on water if sea is calm.%0a%3c * Talks with God. %0a%3c !!!!oboist%0a%3c * Leaps short buildings with a running start and favorable winds.%0a%3c * Is almost as powerful as a switch engine.%0a%3c * Is almost as fast as a speeding bullet.%0a%3c * Walks on water in an indoor swimming pool.%0a%3c * Talks with God if special request is approved. %0a%3c !!!!trumpet player%0a%3c * Barely clears a quonset hut.%0a%3c * Loses tug-of-war with locomotive.%0a%3c * Can fire a speeding bullet.%0a%3c * Swims well.%0a%3c * Is occasionally addressed by God. %0a%3c !!!!bassoonist%0a%3c * Makes marks high on wall when trying to clear short buildings.%0a%3c * Is run over by locomotive.%0a%3c * Can sometimes handle a gun without inflicting self-injury.%0a%3c * Dog-paddles.%0a%3c * Talks to animals. %0a%3c !!!!second violinist%0a%3c * Runs into buildings.%0a%3c * Recognizes locomotives two times out of three.%0a%3c * Is not issued any ammunition.%0a%3c * Can stay afloat with a life jacket.%0a%3c * Talks to walls, argues with self. %0a%3c !!!!manager%0a%3c * Falls over doorstep when trying to enter buildings.%0a%3c * Says "Look at the choo-choo."%0a%3c * Wets self with water pistol.%0a%3c * Plays in mud puddles.%0a%3c * Loses arguments with self. %0a%3c !!!!horn player%0a%3c * Lifts buildings and walks under them.%0a%3c * Kicks locomotives off the tracks.%0a%3c * Catches speeding bullets in teeth and eats them.%0a%3c * Freezes water with a single glance.%0a%3c * Is God. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!Math/Logic Quiz%0a%3c %0a%3c * Wilson is tired of paying for clarinet reeds. If he adopts a policy of playing only on rejected reeds from his colleagues will he be able to retire on the money he has saved if he invests it in mutual bonds, yielding 8.7%25, before he is fired from his job? If not, calculate the probablitity of him ever working in a professional symphony orchestra again!%0a%3c * Jethro has been playing the double bass in a symphony orchestra for 12 years, three months and seven days. Each day, his inclination to practice decreases by the equation: (total days in the orchestra) x 0.0076. Assuming he stopped practising altogether four years, six months and three days ago, how long will it be before he is completely unable to play the double bass?%0a%3c * Wilma plays in the second violin section, but specializes in making disparaging remarks about conductors and other musicians. The probability of her making a negative comment about any given musician is 4 chances in 7, and for conductors is 16 chances out of 17. If there are 103 musicians in the orchestra and the orchestra sees 26 different conductors each year, how many negative remarks does Wilma make in a two-year period? How does this change if five of the musicians are also conductors? What if six of the conductors are also musicians?%0a%3c * Horace is the General Manager of an important symphony orchestra. He tries to hear at least four concerts a year. Assuming that at each concert the orchestra plays a minimum of three pieces per concert, what are the chances that Horace can avoid hearing a single work by Mozart, Beethoven or Brahms in the next ten years?%0a%3c * Betty plays in the viola section. Despite her best efforts she is unable to play with the rest of the orchestra and, on average, plays 0.3528 seconds behind the rest of the viola section, which is already 0.16485 seconds behind the rest of the orchestra. If the orchestra is moving into a new concert hall with a reverberation time of 2.7 seconds, will she be able to continue playing this way undetected?%0a%3c * Ralph loves to drink coffee. Each week he drinks three more cups of coffee than Harold, who drinks exactly one third the amount that the entire brass section consumes in beer. How much longer is Ralph going to live?%0a%3c * Rosemary is unable to play in keys with more than three sharps or flats without making an inordinate number of mistakes. Because her colleagues in the cello section are also struggling in these passages she has so far been able to escape detection. What is the total number of hours they would all have to practice to play the complete works of Richard Strauss?%0a---%0a> %0a> %0a> %25trail%25 '''Categories:''' [[!HumorousStuff]]%0a> '''Tags:''' (:tags musicians, funny, jokes:)%0a
