It had started having problems delivering a charge to the battery and current to the system. The little blinky `LEDs on the attachment were flickering between yellow and red. Turns out this is a known problem with the power brick. I bought a new one ($80) and it did the trick.%0a%3c %0a%3c I wonder how long apple will support the powerbook G4 and have that power brick available. With luck, they won't redesign it and obsolete the current one. If that happens, I'll try to snatch up 2 or 3 of them. I guess that's a potential problem with a second-hand product.
