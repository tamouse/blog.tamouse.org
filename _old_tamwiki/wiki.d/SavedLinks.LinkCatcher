The intervention task was chosen based on a cognitive task analysis designed to determine the attentional and multi-modal demands of the game. Improvements on a measure of attention were found for the intervention group compared to controls.

Linehan of the University of Washington made a striking admission. Known for her pioneering work on borderline personality disorder (BPD), a severe and intractable psychiatric condition, 68-year-old Linehan announced that as an adolescent, she had been hospitalized for BPD. Suicidal and self-destructive, the teenage Linehan had slashed her limbs repeatedly with knives and other sharp objects and banged her head violently against the hospital walls. The hospital's discharge summary in 1963 described her as "one of the most disturbed patients in the hospital." Yet despite a second hospitalization, Linehan eventually improved and earned a Ph.D. from Chicago's Loyola University in 1971.%0a> %0a> ->Many psychologists and psychiatrists were taken aback by Linehan's courageous admission, which received high-profile coverage in the New York Times. Part of their surprise almost surely stemmed from an uncomfortable truth: people with BPD are often regarded as hopeless individuals, destined to a life of emotional misery. They are also frequently viewed as so disturbed that they cannot possibly achieve success in everyday life. As a consequence, highly accomplished individuals such as Linehan do not fit the stereotypical mold of a former BPD sufferer. But as Linehan's case suggests, much of the intense pessimism and stigma surrounding this disorder are unjustified. Indeed, few psychological disorders are more mischaracterized or misunderstood.%0a> %0a> ->Tags: (:tags psychology, borderline, bipolar, Linehan, bookmark:)%0a> -->Posted: 2012-1-5 6:42%0a> %0a> %0a

Nearly 6,000 hours in total. It would be prohibitively expensive just to outsource that much work. But Imus' 35-year veteran of cartography who's designed every kind of map for every kind of client - did it all by himself. He used a computer (not a pencil and paper), but absolutely nothing was left to computer-assisted happenstance. Imus spent eons tweaking label positions. Slaving over font types, kerning, letter thicknesses. Scrutinizing levels of blackness. It's the kind of personal cartographic touch you might only find these days on the hand-illustrated ski-trail maps available at posh mountain resorts.%0a> %0a> A few of his more significant design decisions: Your standard wall map will often paint the U.S. states different colors so their shapes are easily grasped. But Imus' map uses thick lines to indicate state borders and reserves the color for more important purposes - green for denser forestation, yellow for population centers. Instead of hypsometric tinting (darker colors for lower elevations, lighter colors for higher altitudes), Imus uses relief shading for a more natural portrait of U.S. terrain.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> ->Tags: (:tags geographic, map making, awesome, bookmark:)%0a> -->Posted: 2012-1-2 22:58%0a

We have the classic five that Aristotle talked about &mdash; sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch &mdash; plus more recently recognized senses of balance, temperature, pain, and body position and movement.

One study published in 2000 particularly grabbed people's attention: When researchers at Caltech showed test subjects a brief flash of light accompanied by two quick tones, many people saw two flashes instead of one. The same effect occurred when the researchers tapped their subjects' skin twice as the light flashed. Vision &mdash; considered our most reliable and dominant sense &mdash; could be altered by sound or touch.%0a> %0a> ->And that wasn't all. Other studies showed that what people saw affected what they heard; that certain types of music or background noise affected how food tasted; and that smells could influence how a texture felt to the touch. %0a> ->Tags: (:tags synesthesia, neuroscience, bookmark:)%0a> -->Posted: 2011-12-12 13:32%0a

Linehan of the University of Washington made a striking admission. Known for her pioneering work on borderline personality disorder (BPD), a severe and intractable psychiatric condition, 68-year-old Linehan announced that as an adolescent, she had been hospitalized for BPD. Suicidal and self-destructive, the teenage Linehan had slashed her limbs repeatedly with knives and other sharp objects and banged her head violently against the hospital walls. The hospital's discharge summary in 1963 described her as "one of the most disturbed patients in the hospital." Yet despite a second hospitalization, Linehan eventually improved and earned a Ph.D. from Chicago's Loyola University in 1971.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->Many psychologists and psychiatrists were taken aback by Linehan's courageous admission, which received high-profile coverage in the New York Times. Part of their surprise almost surely stemmed from an uncomfortable truth: people with BPD are often regarded as hopeless individuals, destined to a life of emotional misery. They are also frequently viewed as so disturbed that they cannot possibly achieve success in everyday life. As a consequence, highly accomplished individuals such as Linehan do not fit the stereotypical mold of a former BPD sufferer. But as Linehan's case suggests, much of the intense pessimism and stigma surrounding this disorder are unjustified. Indeed, few psychological disorders are more mischaracterized or misunderstood.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->Tags: (:tags psychology, borderline, bipolar, Linehan, bookmark:)%0a%3c -->Posted: 2012-1-5 6:42%0a

Nearly 6,000 hours in total. It would be prohibitively expensive just to outsource that much work. But Imus' 35-year veteran of cartography who's designed every kind of map for every kind of client - did it all by himself. He used a computer (not a pencil and paper), but absolutely nothing was left to computer-assisted happenstance. Imus spent eons tweaking label positions. Slaving over font types, kerning, letter thicknesses. Scrutinizing levels of blackness. It's the kind of personal cartographic touch you might only find these days on the hand-illustrated ski-trail maps available at posh mountain resorts.%0a%3c %0a%3c A few of his more significant design decisions: Your standard wall map will often paint the U.S. states different colors so their shapes are easily grasped. But Imus' map uses thick lines to indicate state borders and reserves the color for more important purposes - green for denser forestation, yellow for population centers. Instead of hypsometric tinting (darker colors for lower elevations, lighter colors for higher altitudes), Imus uses relief shading for a more natural portrait of U.S. terrain.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c ->Tags: (:tags geographic, map making, awesome, bookmark:)%0a%3c -->Posted: 2012-1-2 22:58%0a

We have the classic five that Aristotle talked about &mdash; sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch &mdash; plus more recently recognized senses of balance, temperature, pain, and body position and movement. Each evolved to collect some distinct type of information about our environment, and to tell us our status within it.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->That's largely how we tend to think about the senses, anyway: separately, each one its own distinct way to understand the world around us.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->But in recent years, various findings have emerged to challenge that assumption &mdash; strange illusions in which one sense seemed to change the perceptions of another. One study published in 2000 particularly grabbed people's attention: When researchers at Caltech showed test subjects a brief flash of light accompanied by two quick tones, many people saw two flashes instead of one. The same effect occurred when the researchers tapped their subjects' skin twice as the light flashed. Vision &mdash; considered our most reliable and dominant sense &mdash; could be altered by sound or touch.%0a%3c %0a%3c ->And that wasn't all. Other studies showed that what people saw affected what they heard; that certain types of music or background noise affected how food tasted; and that smells could influence how a texture felt to the touch. %0a%3c ->Tags: (:tags synesthesia, neuroscience, bookmark:)%0a%3c -->Posted: 2011-12-12 13:32%0a
