While popping open a can of Hormel is pretty dang easy, it's also not
quite so satisfying sometimes. Here's a quick stove-top chili recipe
that comes out pretty nice and is a great basis for further
experimentation.

Variations
----------

This basic recipe lends itself well to variations:

-   chopped, roasted jalape??os (chipotles)
-   mild, green roasted chili peppers
-   fresh, chopped haba??eros
-   other veggies go in well, too:
    -   grated carrots
    -   grated zucchini
    -   chopped bell peppers
    -   stewed tomatoes
-   black beans instead of kidney beans
-   white navy beans
-   lima beans

<span id="salsanote"></span> \* There are many varieties of salsa to
choose from in most supermarkets. Different heat indexes, different
consistencies, different ingredients. Use whatever floats your boat. I'm
partial to Pace Medium Chunky Salsa.

<span id="beans"></span> \*\* If you don't want to use canned beans, you
can use dried beans instead, provided you prepare them well by boiling,
soaking, draining, etc.

(How this recipe could have won a blue ribbon as it stands is beyond me.
Maybe in Minnesota!)
