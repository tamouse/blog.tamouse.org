This is surprisingly simple and so delicious! I first had baked nachos
from a little hole-in-the-wall burrito place in Santa Clara, whose name
escapes me now. They had great burritos though, and this was what they
made of nachos!

Directions
----------

1.  Pre-heat oven to 350℉.
2.  Brown the ground beef with the onions and the seasoning mix well.
    Drain.
3.  Place a doule layer of foil on a cooking tray, curling up the edges
    of the foil to form a leak barrier
4.  Spread the chips on the foil
5.  Layer the ground beef mixture onto the chips, spreading out so it
    covers well
6.  Layer the cheese on the beef and chips
7.  Place salsa around at various spots (you don't want to use too much
    or cover too heavily)
8.  Place in oven and bake for 15-20 minutes -- be careful not to let
    the chips burn!
9.  Serve with sour cream and guacamole for garnish'

Variations
----------

-   See <span
    class="wikiword">[SimpleNachos](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.SimpleNachos?action=print)</span>
    for a quickie version -- not as good, but ok for quick nacho
    emergencies!
-   If you like jalape??os, feel free. Even better would be to go all
    the way to roasted jalape??os, aka chipolte.
-   You can put in practically any sort of meat, seasoned properly:
    chicken (pollo), steak (carne asada), pork (carnitas). Or even leave
    out the meat entirely, cheese nachos bake up really well!
